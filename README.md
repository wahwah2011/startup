# Reaction Time

[My Notes](notes.md)

_Reaction Time_ is a real-time, competitive study tool designed to gamify the memorization of chemical nomenclature, polyatomic ions, and organic functional groups.

Users register for an account and access a "Study Deck" where they view chemical names (e.g., "Acetate" or "Benzene") and reveal the corresponding chemical formula or structure. The application integrates with the PubChem API to dynamically fetch and render accurate molecular visualizations for each card.

The core technical differentiator is the Real-Time Leaderboard. As users successfully "master" flashcards, their scores are updated in a persistent database and instantly broadcast via Web Sockets to all other connected users. This creates a live, ticking leaderboard where students can see their class ranking change second-by-second as they study, fostering a sense of urgency and competition.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Studying for chemistry is usually a lonely, static experience—you stare and sift through pieces of paper until they are memorized. But we know that competition drives engagement.

_Reaction Time_ turns rote memorization into a live multiplayer race. It’s a flashcard app where you aren't just studying against yourself; you are studying against the entire class in real-time. Imagine sitting in the library, flipping through your organic functional groups, and seeing your name physically jump past your lab partner on the leaderboard because you studied five more cards than they did.

Using real chemical data and real-time socket connections, we ensure that every point you score is felt by everyone else online, making the tedious part of chemistry—memorization—feel like a live e-sport.
